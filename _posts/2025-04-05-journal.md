Last weekend I had read this book called "Siddhartha By Hermen Hesse". It was a good book. Few lines that impressed me from this book are

- "I can fast, I can think and I can wait"
- "Don't follow teachers/preachings, follow your heart and figure things out"
- "Knowledge is figuring out the path, wisdom is walking through the path"

- [X] Need to hit the gym
- [] I need to atleast implement the skiplist part with iterator for kvarkDB
- [] read through the fix code
- [X] attempt abc400
